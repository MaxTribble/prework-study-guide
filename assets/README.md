# Prework Study Guide for Coding Boot Camp

## Description

I created this Study Guide for other new DU students starting the Coding Boot Camp. It was created to showcase notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript.

- I wanted to help other students with thier prework for the Boot Camp
- This is a good place for students to reveiw before or while they're going through the prework. Additionally, it is a good place to look back on for reveiw after starting class
- I learned how to use HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript to create a functional webpage.

## Installation

N/A.

## Usage

Most of the content is accessible by simply opening the page. There are notes readable in english on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. However, if you open the DevTools console, Javascript is running and can randomly suggest a topic to study first by refreashing the page.
